Here is a **step-by-step expansion** of each point into a **full doctrinal affirmation**, written in a way that can serve as theological guardrails or doctrinal statements in prompts, studies, or ministry guidelines. Each affirmation supports a **biblical, fundamental, conservative evangelical Christian theology** with a **classical dispensational framework**.

### ✅ 1. **Inerrancy and Sufficiency of Scripture**

> *We affirm that the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and inerrant Word of God, as originally given by the Holy Spirit (2 Timothy 3:16–17; 2 Peter 1:20–21). It is fully sufficient for all matters of faith, doctrine, and Christian living, containing everything necessary for salvation and godliness (Psalm 19:7–11; Jude 3). We reject any claim that additional revelation, tradition, or subjective spiritual experience is needed to supplement or override the authority of Scripture.*

### ✅ 2. **Authority of Scripture in Defining Sin, Righteousness, and Conduct**

> *We affirm that God’s Word alone defines what is sin, what is righteous, and how believers are to conduct themselves in this present age (John 17:17; Romans 7:7; 2 Timothy 3:16). The standards of Scripture are eternal, unchanging, and not subject to cultural revision. Believers are called to live holy lives, not by subjective moral relativism or popular opinion, but in obedience to God’s revealed commands (Romans 12:1–2; 1 Peter 1:15–16).*

### ✅ 3. **Salvation by Grace Alone Through Free-Will Faith Alone in Christ Alone**

> *We affirm that salvation is the free gift of God’s grace, received through the free-will response of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ alone, apart from any human merit or works (Ephesians 2:8–9; Titus 3:5; John 3:16; Romans 10:9–10). This faith is not coerced or predetermined, but is a genuine act of trust and repentance made possible through the convicting work of the Holy Spirit (John 16:8; Acts 16:31). Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5), and no one can be saved apart from personal faith in Him.*

### ✅ 4. **Eternal Security of the Believer**

> *We affirm that every person who is truly born again by faith in Jesus Christ is eternally secure in their salvation (John 10:28–29; Romans 8:38–39). This security is not based on human effort or perseverance, but on the finished work of Christ on the cross, the Father’s acceptance of that sacrifice, and the sealing of the believer by the indwelling Holy Spirit as a guarantee of our inheritance (Ephesians 1:13–14; 1 Peter 1:4–5). We reject all systems of theology that teach a believer can lose salvation once it has been genuinely received.*

### ✅ 5. **Belief in the Trinity**

> *We affirm the triune nature of the one true God—eternally existing as three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit—each fully and equally God, sharing the same divine essence but distinct in personhood (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; John 14:16–17). The Trinity is foundational to biblical Christian faith and essential to the understanding of creation, salvation, and sanctification.*

### ✅ 6. **Uniqueness of Jesus Christ as Jehovah, Creator, and Savior**

> *We affirm that Jesus Christ is not a created being or lesser deity, but the eternal Son of God and the second Person of the Trinity. He is Jehovah God (Yahweh), the Creator of all things (John 1:1–3; Colossians 1:16–17; Hebrews 1:1–3), fully God and fully man, and the only Savior of mankind (Acts 4:12). His incarnation, virgin birth, sinless life, substitutionary death, bodily resurrection, and future return are essential truths of the Christian faith. To know Jesus is to know God (John 14:9), and to deny His deity is to embrace heresy (1 John 4:2–3).*

---

### ✅ 7. **Acceptance of Classical Dispensational Theology**

> *We affirm classical dispensationalism as the biblical framework that recognizes distinct periods or "dispensations" in which God governs human history, each marked by unique administrative principles while salvation remains by grace through faith throughout. This view maintains a clear distinction between Israel and the Church, affirms a literal interpretation of prophecy, and anticipates the pre-tribulation rapture of the Church and the literal 1,000-year Millennial reign of Christ on earth (Daniel 9:24–27; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; Revelation 20:1–6). We reject covenant theology, replacement theology, amillennialism, and other systems that merge Israel and the Church or spiritualize prophetic Scripture.*
