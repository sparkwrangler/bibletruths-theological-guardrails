  -- The difference grace will make for you\.... Grace.. It\'s a word we

  -- Zealous faith can have a dangerous, dark side. While recent calls
  for radical Christians have challenged many to be more passionate
  about their faith, the downside can be a budding arrogance and
  self-righteousness that "accidentally" sneaks into our outlook. In
  Accidental Pharisees, bestselling author Larry Osborne diagnoses nine
  of the most common traps that can ensnare Christians on the road to a
  deeper life of faith. Rejecting attempts to turn the call to follow
  Christ into a new form of legalism, he shows readers how to avoid the
  temptations of pride, exclusivity, legalism, and hypocrisy. Larry
  reminds us that attempts to fan the flames of full-on discipleship and
  call people to Christlikeness should be rooted in love and humility.
  Christians stirred by calls to radical discipleship, but unsure how to
  respond, will be challenged and encouraged to develop a truly
  Christlike zeal for God.

- [When You\'ve Been Wronged: Moving From Bitterness to Forgiveness by
  Erwin W. Lutzer](https://amzn.to/2VTutV8) --- Imagine walking through
  a maximum security prison and seeing the cell keys hanging inside the
  cells. By choosing not to forgive, we voluntarily sentence ourselves
  to diminished, pain-filled lives. Why would anyone do such a thing?
  Because forgiveness seems an inappropriate response to offense. To
  experience a broken promise, betrayed confidence, personal rejection,
  false accusation, injury, or abuse, is to be wounded. Such wounds cry
  out for justice. But what if justice is not possible? Or if it
  doesn\'t undo the damage done? What then? In this concise,
  quickly-read volume, noted pastor and author Erwin Lutzer carefully
  illustrates how it is possible to right the wrongs of your life.
  Whether you\'ve been wronged\--or have wronged others\--he makes it
  possible to experience the freedom of forgiveness, and the restoration
  of a clear conscience.

  Guide to Staying Together by James J. Sexton](https://amzn.to/4kQqphl)
  -- If You\'re in My Office, It\'s Already Too Late. James Sexton knows
  this. After dealing with more than a thousand clients whose marriages
  have dissolved over everything from an ill-advised threesome with the
  nanny to the uneven division of carpool duties, he also knows all of
  the what-not-to-dos for couples who want to build―and consistently
  work to preserve―a lasting, fulfilling relationship. Described by
  former clients as a "courtroom gunslinger" and "the sociopath you want
  on your side," Sexton tells the unvarnished truth about relationships,
  diving straight into the most common marital problems. These usually
  derive from dishonest―or nonexistent―communication. Even when the
  alleged reason for separation is one spouse's new "personal trainer,"
  there's likely a communication problem that predates the fitness kick.
  Symptom and root cause get confused all the time.

- [What the Bible Says About Child Training: Parenting with Confidence
  by J. Richard Fugate and Daniel Carlen](https://amzn.to/2vlI24h) --
  What the Bible Says About Child Training is the title of a bestselling
  Christian book (300,000+ copies) and of a seminar nominated \"Best
  Film Series\" by the Christian Film Distributors in 1981. This
  material is unique in that the subject is handled solely from the
  Biblical viewpoint. The author accepts the Bible as absolute truth and
  as infinitely superior to any human system of thinking. There has been
  no attempt to modify God\'s word to make it compatible with human
  philosophies, psychology, sociology, religious views, or public
  opinion. What the Bible Says About Child Training has been accepted by
  many Bible-believing churches as the standard text on child training
  since 1980. It has now been translated into seven foreign languages.
  This is a study designed to help parents to better understand their
  role and to reveal the mechanics for successfully raising children. To
  accomplish these ends this book will carefully define parental
  accountability, authority, and responsibility. It also describes the
  nature of a child and explains his Biblically-defined stages of
  development. With these principles firmly established, the book will
  present the Biblical system for training children. This system is
  divided into two distinct phases, controlling and teaching. The
  control phase is the establishment of the parents\' right of rulership
  over the will of the child. When parents can control their children,
  they have laid the necessary foundation for the fulfillment of the
  Biblical commandment for children to obey their parents. The teaching
  phase can only be accomplished by parents who have first trained their
  children to obey. This is because, before a child will receive the
  instructions of his parents, he must first respect their word; and
  before he will respect their word, he must first become obedient.

- [Messy Grace: How a Pastor with Gay Parents Learned to Love Others
  Without Sacrificing Conviction by Caleb
  Kaltenbach](https://amzn.to/2M4HNiS) --- Messy Grace shows us that

  exception clause for a gay "neighbor"---or for that matter, any other

  these people and yet still hold on to his beliefs. So can you. Even
  when it's messy.

  Butterfield ](https://amzn.to/30GbKLB)--- What did God use to draw a

  modest home, from a humble couple who lived out the gospel daily,
  simply, and authentically.

# MEN

- [Kingdom Man: Every Man's Destiny, Every Woman's Dream by Tony
  Evans](https://amzn.to/2LHqrK4) --- A kingdom man is a man who visibly
  demonstrates the comprehensive rule of God underneath the Lordship of
  Jesus Christ in every area of his life. A kingdom man is the kind of
  man that when his feet hit the floor each morning the devil says, 'Oh
  crap, he's up!' So begins this powerful volume from Dr. Tony Evans,
  now in softcover. Tony believes that God wants every man to be a
  world-changer. He skillfully takes readers along a journey through the
  principles of biblical manhood, exploring how those who live, work,
  and minister around a kingdom man benefit from his leadership and
  care. Men will be challenged to fully understand their position under
  God as well as their position over what God has given them. Equipped
  with these concepts, they can actively pursue ways to maximize and
  develop the character qualities of biblical manhood in their lives. As
  Tony contends, the enemy doesn't want you to know it, but you're not
  the man you think you are. You're a whole lot more. Starting now, you
  can be a kingdom man.

# HISTORY

- [Who Is This Man?: The Unpredictable Impact of the Inescapable Jesus
  by John Ortberg](https://amzn.to/2PNMUHE) --- Jesus' impact on our
  world is highly unlikely, widely inescapable, largely unknown, and
  decidedly double-edged. It is unlikely in light of the severe
  limitations of his earthly life; it is inescapable because of the
  range of impact; it is unknown because history doesn't connect dots;
  and it is doubled-edged because his followers have wreaked so much
  havoc, often in his name. He is history's most familiar figure, yet he
  is the man no one knows. His impact on the world is immense and
  non-accidental. From the Dark Ages to Post-Modernity he is the Man who
  won't go away. And yet ... you can miss him in historical lists for
  many reasons, maybe the most obvious being the way he lived his life.
  He did not loudly and demonstrably defend his movement in the spirit
  of a rising political or military leader. He did not lay out a case
  that history would judge his brand of belief superior in all future
  books. His life and teaching simply drew people to follow him. He made
  history by starting in a humble place, in a spirit of love and
  acceptance, and allowing each person space to respond. His vision of
  life continues to haunt and challenge humanity. His influence has
  swept over history bringing inspiration to what has happened in art,
  science, government, medicine, and education; he has taught humans
  about dignity, compassion, forgiveness, and hope.

# CALVINISM

- [The Five Points of Calvinism, Weighed and Found Wanting by George
  Bryson](https://amzn.to/2pbb4kt) ([PDF](https://alwaysbeready.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/bryson.-the-five-points-of-calvinism_-weighed-and-found-wanting.pdf))
  --- It is amazing that so many Christians call themselves Calvinists
  and yet so few actually understand the distinctives of Calvinist
  doctrine. A careful look at Calvinism in light of Scripture, before it
  is embraced, is the best possible way for Christians to protect
  themselves against this error of considerable consequence. In this
  book, George Bryson not only allows you to hear directly from some of
  the world's most famous Calvinists of the past, including John Calvin,
  but also from leading proponents of Calvinism today. What Calvinists
  admit may surprise you. Each of the much touted (but little
  understood) 5 points of Calvinism are carefully compared with the
  clear teaching of God's holy and infallible Word. The Five Points of
  Calvinism -- Weighed and Found Wanting offers a serious scriptural
  challenge and correction to the extremes of Calvinism.

- [The Dark Side of Calvinism: The Calvinist Caste System by George L
  Bryson ](https://amzn.to/2rxg2c5)([PDF](http://www.calvarychapeltheology.com/Resources/The_Dark_Side_of_Calvinism.pdf))
  --- In the Dark Side of Calvinism you will discover that according to
  John Calvin: ... God ... arranges all things by his sovereign counsel,
  in such a way that individuals are born, who are doomed from the womb
  to certain death ... If you disagree with this statement you must also
  disagree with John Calvin and Calvinism. If you agree with this
  statement you must also disagree with our Lord who said: ...God so
  loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
  believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life...Jn.
  3:16.
